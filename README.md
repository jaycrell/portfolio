# about me 
Greetings and salutations! My name is Juliette Crellin (she/her), and I'm working toward my Masters of Science in Public Policy and Management at Heinz College. I'm originally from New York City, but I'm passing the pandemic in Pittsburgh. Before coming to Heinz College, I was serving as a Peace Corps Volunteer in the Republic of Moldova until I was evacuated due to COVID-19. In my free time I like cooking, reading about, and consuming good food; exploring the outside world; and watching movies.

# what I hope to learn 
I like data anaylsis and graphic design, so I'm hoping to combine those skills in this class. Once I graduate, I would love a position where I can draw upon these skills to present the results of program evaluations or research. Overall, I want a position where I can help improve the impact and effectiveness public programming, and I think telling stories with data fits nicely with my interests and skillset. 


# portfolio
I'll be putting all my visualizations here. Stay tuned!
