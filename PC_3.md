<h3> Final Project: <a href="https://carnegiemellon.shorthandstories.com/Peace-Corps-mental-health/index.html" target="_blank"> Peace Corps Volunteers Need Better Mental Health Support </a></h3>

<h2 id="update"> Updates from Part II </h2>
<p> I have changed many aspects of my project since Part II. During Part II, I was really struggling to figure out how to structure my story. I wanted to discuss my experience in Moldova, early termination rates globally, and what may be causing those rates. Although I still think this story would have been interesting, I had hit a bit of a wall when unemployment was the only potential correlation I found with early termination rates. I could have made this into a story about how the Peace Corps needs to ensure that volunteers have meaningful work, but I didn’t have a swath of available data about volunteer projects.
<br><br>
My project shifted when I was making a chart about volunteers’ behavioral health conditions that one of my interviewees had requested. 
<br><br>
Although there’s a significant amount of data about volunteers’ behavioral health conditions, I had largely ignored it after failing to find a correlation with early termination rates. I had also struggled with the behavioral health data because the Peace Corps uses a convoluted rate calculation. (The calculation involves creating a new denominator variable called Volunteer-Trainee Year, which is supposed to account for people in the country of service less than a full year). I wasn’t sure about the validity of comparing the behavioral health rate to the early termination rate (a simple rate calculation), so I started looking at raw numbers. This is when I noticed the rising rate of behavioral health conditions, which has formed the basis of my current project.
<br><br>
I started transitioning to focus more on behavioral health, but I was reluctant to abandon all the work I had already done on early terminations. I wish I still had my first Shorthand for reference because it was kind of a disjunctive disaster. I was trying to lead with my original story about rising early termination rates, followed by rising behavioral health rates. The only connection I could offer was that there didn’t really seem to be a correlation beyond what I’d observed in Moldova. As one of my user research interviewees pointed out, I was trying to do too much. 
<br><br>
My story really came together after a pretty brutal (but essential) user research session. My charts individually seemed okay, but my structure was clearly problematic. I restructured the story to transition from Moldova to behavioral health conditions to early termination rates. I also simplified it by removing extraneous details about early termination rates and started using them as reason to care about behavior health condition rates. I presented this version on Monday, which approximates my final version save a few tweaks from my final user research interviewee.
<br><br>
Returned Peace Corps Volunteers and people serving in the Peace Corps administration are my primary target audience for this project. During the user research for Part II, I conducted formal interviews with three Returned Peace Corps Volunteers from Thailand, Moldova, and Zambia. Although their responses varied, the interviews made me feel pretty confident about how this portion of the target audience would react to my project. 
<br><br>
I was more nervous about how someone from the Peace Corps administration would respond, particularly to the cove photo with the whited out faces of Peace Corps Volunteers. During Part II, I interviewed one person as a Congressional / Peace Corps administration proxy, and he had described it as “tough but fair.” Although this response was better than I’d expected, I still fretted that his distance from the Peace Corps meant he would have a less visceral response to the content. I had been procrastinating contacting someone from Peace Corps Moldova because I was nervous to show them the project and because I wanted to make sure I had a clean draft, since I figured I’d only have one chance to talk to them. 
<br><br>
After submitting Part II, I finally worked up the courage to contact someone at Peace Corps Moldova because I knew it was an essential aspect of my user research. I finally interviewed someone from the Peace Corps on Tuesday, March 16, and it actually went really well. I’m so glad I did it because she brought up some questions about data analysis methodology and data sources that other interviewees hadn’t asked me. She was also unfamiliar with some of the terminology that I thought was common knowledge. It was also great to hear her perspective on the issue of behavioral health conditions among Peace Corps Volunteers. She gave me some great feedback, she wasn’t offended by the project, and she thought it was really important. I think getting her feedback also motivated me to make the language of the project less combative toward Peace Corps because it reminded me that they are trying in their own way.
<br><br>
Finally, she requested I send her the final version so she could send it up the chain of command. This final version contains her edits.
</p>
<h3> Some Design Decisions </h3>
 <p> I wanted to keep the design minimalist. I wanted my hero photo with shock value, and I didn't want to dull the message with any stereotypical happy Peace Corps Volunteers. I also didn't want to use stock images of mental health because I think the data in the charts speak for themselves about how serious the situation is. <br>
 Although I didn't want to use Peace Corps' logo, I used its brand colors for consistency and as a constant reminder that this is about Peace Corps, a U.S. government agency. It was also nice that the red feels very urgent. </p>

 <i> Terminology </i><br>
 <b>Comment:</b> “Include behavioral health condition is as defined by OHS” <br>
 <b>Response:</b> This was helpful because I’d thought that people working at Peace Corps would have been familiar with this terminology. <br>
 <b>Next Steps:</b> I’m going to add the definition for behavioral health condition in the first section about Moldova. I think I’ll also move the top four behavioral health conditions to this part for context.
<br><br>
 <i> Unit Chart - Behavioral Health Estimation </i> <br>
 <b>Comment:</b> “How did you estimate this?” <br>
 <b>Response:</b> It was great to be asked this because it was the first time my methodology was question.<br>
 <b>Next Steps:</b> Include that the estimation is based on Moldova’s rate from the health of the volunteer - 2018
<br><br>
 <i>Behavioral Health Raw Number Column Chart</i> <br>
 <b>Comment:</b> “Who's diagnosing? These are new things from in-country or were they conditions volunteers came in with?”<br>
 <b>Response:</b> While I think this is a great question, I don’t have the answer about what’s pre-existing and what was diagnosed in-country. I think it does not really affect my report, but I will try to change phrasing around this.<br>
 <b>Next Steps:</b> I’ll change some of the terminology around behavioral health diagnoses to try to reflect that they are diagnoses, but only because the PCMO responds to what people report.
<br><br>
   <i>Call to Action</i><br>
 <b>Comment:</b> “The counseling and outreach unit - now BHO - to be more inclusive for people within the behavioral health lens - the idea that people can go there for more support than just counseling. The agency is advocating for increased support. Budget is a huge part of this.”<br>
 <b>Response:</b> It was good to talk to someone from the agency about what it’s trying to do to better support the mental health support of volunteers. I want to try to incorporate the budgetary constraint in my final project to acknowledge the challenges.<br>
 <b>Next Steps:</b> I’m going to try to address this a bit in my call to action, and provide more specific ideas about what Peace Corps can do to help volunteers, like using tele group therapy.<br>
   <br>
   <i> Note:</i> This interviwee had limited time, so this interview didn't go through the entire user research script. I didn't tell her anything about the report, and instead had her go through it herself and ask me questions/give comments.

   <b>Comment:</b> I don't understand what this chart is telling me becase there’s no title on the chart. Why are the most recent columns red? Remove color differentiation, and put a clearer title.
   <br>
   <b>Response & Next Steps:</b> Given these comments, I decided to change this column chart to a line chart for the final presentation because I decided the three most recent years of ET rates were no longer the most important aspect of the chart.
