<h1> Why are Volunteers Leaving Service Early? <br>
 Final Project Part 3 </h1>

<h2> Story Board Version 3 </h2>
<h3> Background </h3>
<p> I got lost a bit in <a href="https://jgcrellin.github.io/portfolio/pc-et-2.html" target="_blank"> Part 2 of this project </a> and realized that I was trying to tackle too much in one project. I regrouped on Friday and decided to focus the project on Early Termination rates, volunteers' mental health issues, and Peace Corps' mental health support to make a more cohesive call to action for increasing mental health resources to volutneers. <br> 
  I created some new charts to reflect this updated focus and drafted a storyboard in Shorthand before conducting additional user research. </p>
  <h3> New Charts </h3>
<h4> Peace Corps Moldova Early Termination Unit Chart</h4> 
<p> Additional Information: In Shorthand, this chart does a reveal transition between images. </p>
