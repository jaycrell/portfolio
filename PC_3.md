<h1> Why are Volunteers Leaving Service Early? <br>
 Final Project Part 3 </h1>

<h2> Story Board Version 3 </h2>
<h3> Background </h3>
<p> I got lost a bit in <a href="https://jgcrellin.github.io/portfolio/pc-et-2.html" target="_blank"> Part 2 of this project </a> and realized that I was trying to tackle too much in one project. I regrouped on Friday and decided to focus the project on Early Termination rates, volunteers' mental health issues, and Peace Corps' mental health support to make a more cohesive call to action for increasing mental health resources to volutneers. <br> 
  I created some new charts to reflect this updated focus and drafted a storyboard in Shorthand before conducting additional user research. </p>

The Peace Corps needs to do more to support volunteers struggling with mental health while serving."

<h5> User Resarch Response </h5>
<h6> Female, 59, Public Relations Professional </h6>
<ul>
 <li> Doesn't understand the connection between the 21 that early terminated (image 3) and the text accompanying it. </li>
 <li> Add an image that's both grey dots and red dots between grey dot image and red dot image. </li>
 <li> Have the first call to action for Peace Corps with the red dots. </li>
  </ul>
