<h1> Why are Volunteers Leaving? </h1>
  <h3> Trying to understand the rising resignation rates among Peace Corps Volunteers </h3>

<h2> Background </h2>

<p> In March of 2020, Peace Corps evacuated more than 7,300 volunteers and indefinitely suspended volunteer service due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The removal of all volunteers was unprecedented, and although Peace Corps has repeatedly suggested dates when volunteers might return to service, it's unclear when posts might re-open. This uncertainty is challenging for the Peace Corps as an agency, its volunteers, and its relationships abroad. However, this time away from the regular service cycle is also an opportunity for Peace Corps to improve itself as an agency. 
  <br><br>
  There are myriad ways in which Peace Corps can improve its programming. The administration can even refer the recent <a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/files.peacecorps.gov/documents/inspector-general/Recurring_Issues_Report_FYs16-19.pdf" target="_blank"> Recurring Issues Report </a> by its own Office of the Inspector General for ideas. Returned Peace Corps Volunteers (RPCVs) are also <a href="https://www.instagram.com/howapcvputsitgently/" target="_blank"> fonts of suggestions</a>. <a href="https://www.instagram.com/decolonizingpc/?hl=en" target="_blank"> Some RPCVs want to shut down the agency entirely</a>.

<h2> This Project </h2>
<p> For this project, I want to explore the rising rate of volunteers resigning from the Peace Corps before they complete their two years of service. The rate of Peace Corps Volunteers leaving service early has always been relatively high (with the lowest rate at 24%), but the rate of Peace Corps Volunteers leaving service early has been increasing every year for the past 5 years of volunteer cohorts. Although I think much of this has to due with the economy growing after the 2009 recession, I want to explore what other factors might cause volunteers to leave service early so Peace Corps can consider how to better support and retain volunteers when it restarts service after the pandemic.
</p>

<h2> Outline </h2>

<h3> Part 1: The Overall Trends </h3>

<h4> Line Chart </h4>
<p> I want to open my project with a simple line chart of the "early termination" (ET) rate increasing between 2012 and 2017. This might be a bit misleading because the rate is increasing from a low in 2012, but I think it will catch the audience's attention. I have this data from the Peace Corps website.</p>

<h4> Area Chart </h4>
<p> Next, I want to show the rising ET rate in relation to the resignation rate (when volunteers choose to leave service). I think this is interesting to look at because the resignation rate has been rising since 2012, but not as quickly as the ET rate. I'll have to take this information from Page 5 of <a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/files.peacecorps.gov/documents/open-government/FY_2019_Early_Termination_Report.pdf" target="_blank"> this Peace Corps early termination report</a> because they don't break the early termination data down by type in the downloadable data set.</p>

<h3> Part 2: Looking by Region and Country </h3>
<h4> Bubble Charts </h4>
<p> My vision for this chart is to start with three bubbles for the Peace Corps regions: Africa, Inter-America and Pacific Region, and Europe, Mediterranean, and Asia region. I thought that the regions would have different ET rates, so I think my readers would also be intrigued to see they're the same. I want the reader to be able to click on the circle of a region and have it break into countries' ET rates within that region, but I'm not sure if that's possible yet. Regardless, the countries' individual ET rates are a bit more interesting and varied. (This also leads to <a href="#1"> known exclusion 1</a>). </p>

<h4>Bar Chart</h4>
<p> After the reader can explore the bubbles a little bit to see the ET rates relative to each other, I want to include a bar chart of the ET rates by country of service. This chart will mainly be to highlight which countries have the highest ET rates (I think I'll compare the 10 highest and 10 lowest for later analyses), but I think including all the bars will be good because if volunteers are reading this they'll want to search for their country of service.</p>

<h2> Project Parameter Notes </h2>
<ol>
  <li id="1"> To control for some outlying high rates of ETs and ETs due to country instability, this part of the project only includes countries that have interrupted service between 2003 and 2017. For example, Ukraine is still a Peace Corps country, but the War in Crimea caused Peace Corps to close the program for a year. Although this doesn't seem to have affected ET rates for the cohort, nonetheless I excluded it for consistency. In contrast, some other countries that shut down like Kiribati and Uzbekistan had very high ET rates of 40% and 70% right before the countries shut service. I think these anomolies are interesting, and I'd like to possibly highlight a few, but it would be in an addendum like this.
    <li> On a similar note, I excluded Montenegro from my data and combined it with Albania because Peace Corps combined Montenegro's ET rate with Albanias since they share country staff, and the country is so new to Peace Corps that it doesn't have significant data.
      <li> A note on interpretting ET years. I think ET rates are best measured by cohort. This means that ET rates for "2017" are actually for the cohort of volunteers that served between 2017 and 2019. This is the latest data available and data from 2020 would be unusable anyway because of evacuation. That being said, for my one year cross-sectional for 2018, I may switch to the ET rate for that year as opposed to for the cohort.

<h2> Data Sources </h2> 
<p> I'll be drawing upon a number of public access data sources for this project, which are all available from Peace Corps's website. I have to clean up some of the sources so their structures match, but then I'll match them using countries of service. Some data comes from data sets downloaded directly from the <a href="https://www.peacecorps.gov/about/open-government/reports/" target="_blank"> Open Government Reports</a> page on the Peace Corps website, while two other sources have to be pulled from Peace Corps reports that don't have the .csv files available for download. Some of these sources are linked earlier in this project description, but the following is a comprehensive list of sources. </p>
<ul>
  <li> Data from Reports
    <ul> 
      <li> For volunteer resignation rates, I'll use data from page 5 of<a href=https://s3.amazonaws.com/files.peacecorps.gov/documents/open-government/FY_2019_Early_Termination_Report.pdf" target="_blank"> FY 2019 Peace Corps Early Termination Report"</a>. This data set will be used to show the trend that ET rates are increasing faster than resignation rates.
      <li> For the mental health of volunteers by country, I'll pull from the table on pages 68 - 71 of <a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/files.peacecorps.gov/documents/open-government/Health_of_the_Volunteer_2018.pdf" target="_blank"> The Health of the Volunteer 2018 </a>. I'll use this data set to look deeper into what may have affected volunteer ET rates in 2018 as a case study and to incorporate medical evacuation rates.
    <li> If I decide to include medical evacuation rates, I'll also use <a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/files.peacecorps.gov/documents/open-government/HOV2017.pdf" target="_blank"> Health of the Volunteer 2017 </a> Unfortunately, Peace Corps didn't start reporting on volunteer mental health until 2018 though.
          </ul>
    <li> Downloaded Data
      <ul>
        <li> For overall ET rates, I may use two sources. For my main measure of ET rates, I'll be using <a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/files.peacecorps.gov/documents/open-government/Cohort_ET_Rates_by_Post_and_FY.csv" target="_blank"> Early Termination Data by Country - Cohort Method - FY 2003-2017 [CSV] </a> I think the cohort method of measurement is preferrable because it gives you a better sense of how many volunteers completed service within a group of volunteers, but since I only have mental health data for 2018, I may have to switch to the annual measure of volunteer ET rates - <a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/files.peacecorps.gov/documents/open-government/Annual_ET_Rates_by_Post_and_FY.csv" target="_blank"> Early Termination Data by Country - Annual Method - FY 2007-2020 [CSV] </a> for my cross-sectional case study.
          <li> For the cross-sectional analysis, I'll also look some of the results of the 2018 Annual Volunteer Survey. I need to clean up the data set, but it's <a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/files.peacecorps.gov/documents/open-government/AVS_2018_Post-level_Means_-_11_13_2018.xlsx" target="_blank"> 2018 Annual Volunteer Survey Results Post Averages [XLS] </a>
          <li> Finally, I'll also use the <a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/files.peacecorps.gov/documents/open-government/2018_Reported_Crime_Victimizations__Incidence_Rates_Tables.xlsx" target="_blank"> Reported Crime Victimizations & Incidence Rates Tables - 2018 [XLSX]</a> to look at how crime could affect volunteers staying in their country of service.
      </ul>

<h2> Notes about the Author </h2>
<p> Juliette Crellin is a Returned Peace Corps Volunteer who served in the Republic of Moldova from June 2018 until she was evacuated due to COVID-19 in March 2020. Like any volunteer, Juliette has many opinions about Peace Corps service that cannot all be represented in this project. Overall, she enjoyed her service and thinks Peace Corps has good intentions at heart, but it needs some work, like all of us. </p>
