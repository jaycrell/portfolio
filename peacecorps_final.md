<h1> Why are Volunteers Leaving? </h1>
  <h3> Trying to understand the rising resignation rates among Peace Corps Volunteers </h3>

<h2> Background </h2>

<p> In March of 2020, Peace Corps evacuated more than 7,300 volunteers and indefinitely suspended volunteer service due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The removal of all volunteers was unprecedented, and although Peace Corps has repeatedly suggested dates when volunteers might return to service, it's unclear when posts might re-open. This uncertainty is challenging for the Peace Corps as an agency, its volunteers, and its relationships abroad. However, this time away from the regular service cycle is also an opportunity for Peace Corps to improve itself as an agency. 
  <br><br>
  There are myriad ways in which Peace Corps can improve its programming. The administration can even refer the recent <a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/files.peacecorps.gov/documents/inspector-general/Recurring_Issues_Report_FYs16-19.pdf" target="_blank"> Recurring Issues Report </a> by its own Office of the Inspector General for ideas. Returned Peace Corps Volunteers (RPCVs) are also <a href="https://www.instagram.com/howapcvputsitgently/" target="_blank"> fonts of suggestions</a>. <a href="https://www.instagram.com/decolonizingpc/?hl=en" target="_blank"> Some RPCVs want to shut down the agency entirely</a>.

<h2> This Project </h2>
<p> For this project, I want to explore the rising rate of volunteers resigning from the Peace Corps before they complete their two years of service. The rate of Peace Corps Volunteers leaving service early has always been relatively high (with the lowest rate at 24%), but the rate of Peace Corps Volunteers leaving service early has been increasing every year for the past 5 years of volunteer cohorts. Although I think much of this has to due with the economy growing after the 2009 recession, I want to explore what other factors might cause volunteers to leave service early so Peace Corps can consider how to better support and retain volunteers when it restarts service after the pandemic.

<h2> Notes about the Author </h2>
<p> Juliette Crellin is a Returned Peace Corps Volunteer who served in the Republic of Moldova from June 2018 until she was evacuated due to COVID-19 in March 2020. Like any volunteer, Juliette has many opinions about Peace Corps service that cannot all be represented in this project. Overall, she enjoyed her service and thinks Peace Corps has good intentions at heart, but it needs some work, like all of us. </p>
