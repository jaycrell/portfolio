<h4> Identifying Representative Interviewees </h4>
<h5> Returned Peace Corps Volunteers </h5>
<p> This will be the easiest group to find representatives from. I want to make sure I get volunteers from different countries of service, so I’m going to find people through the CMU Peace Corps WhatsApp group or the Pittsburgh Peace Corps Association on Facebook. </p>

<h5> Peace Corps Administration </h5>
<p> I don’t have a significant number of contacts at the Peace Corps’ administration, so it’s going to be a bit more difficult to identify a representative person in this group. I’m in the process of arranging an interview with a staff member at Peace Corps Moldova. If she’s not available, I’ll use someone who works in public administration as a proxy.
  <br> 
  I think it’s most important that this person works in public administration and is not a recently Returned Peace Corps Volunteer because I want them to view the project from the perspective of the administration. If I interview someone who’s not in the Peace Corps administration, I’ll have to explain some terminology, and I’ll start the interview by asking them to view the project as if it were about their place of employment.
