<h2> User Research </h2>
<h4> Target Audience </h4> 
<ul>
  <li> Returned Peace Corps Volunteers </li>
  <li> Peace Corps administration </li>
  <li> Invested members of Congress </li>
  </ul>
<h4> Identifying Representative Interviewees </h4>
<h5> Returned Peace Corps Volunteers </h5>
<p> This will be the easiest group to find representatives from. I want to make sure I get volunteers from different countries of service, so I’m going to find people through the CMU Peace Corps WhatsApp group or the Pittsburgh Peace Corps Association on Facebook. </p>

<h5> Peace Corps Administration </h5>
<p> I don’t have a significant number of contacts at the Peace Corps’ administration, so it’s going to be a bit more difficult to identify a representative person in this group. I’m in the process of arranging an interview with a staff member at Peace Corps Moldova. If she’s not available, I’ll use someone who works in public administration as a proxy.
  <br> 
  I think it’s most important that this person works in public administration and is not a recently Returned Peace Corps Volunteer because I want them to view the project from the perspective of the administration. If I interview someone who’s not in the Peace Corps administration, I’ll have to explain some terminology, and I’ll start the interview by asking them to view the project as if it were about their place of employment.
        </p>
<h5> Invested Members of Congress </h5>    
<p> I think this role will also be fulfilled by someone who works outside of the Peace Corps and has not been a volunteer. Members of Congress would be more interested in this project because of its impact on budgets and taxpayer dollars, so I think a taxpayer will serve as a reasonable proxy. </p>
<h4> Interview Goals </h4>
<p> Generally, I want to know:
  <ul> 
    <li> whether my charts are clear individually, and </li>
    <li> whether they logically connect </li>
    <li> whether this story drives them to act upon the call to action. </li>
    </ul>
Specifically, I want to gauge whether I’ve successfully transitioned from talking about Peace Corps early termination rates to discussing the other problems in the Peace Corps. After struggling to find many clear correlations between specific problems and early termination rates (other than unemployment), I’ve decided to highlight problems in the Peace Corps that might be influencing early termination rates. I want this section to flow in this way:
<ul>
  <li> Highlight problems in the Peace Corps that might be contributing to early termination rates </li>
  <li> Compare how volunteers think the Peace Corps needs to improve to how the administration thinks the program needs to improve </li>
  <li> End with a call to action to contact Peace Corps administration. </li>
  </ul>
    </p>
<h4> Interview Script</h4>
<h5> Introduction: All interviewees</h5>
  <p> I'm doing a project for my Telling Stories with Data class, and I want to interview you for user research. We can discuss the project and specific charts at the end, but I won't answer questions before then so I don't influence your responses. </p>
<h5> Introduction: Interviewees Unaffiliated with Peace Corps </h5>
<p> Before we start, I want to introduce some Peace Corps terminology that you'll need to understand this report:
  <ul> 
    <li> The early termination rate measures the number of volunteers that leave service (for any reason other than evacuation) prior to completing the two years of service. </li>
    <li> A cohort is a group of volunteers that start service at the same time. </li>
    <li> When you’re assessing this project, please try to consider it from the perspective of the Peace Corps’ administration.</li>
</ul>
<h5> Opening Question </h5>
<ul> 
  <li> Based on the title, what do you think this story is going to be about? </li>
  </ul>
<h5> Questions Per Chart </h5>
<ul>
  <li> Can you describe to me what this is telling you? </li>
  <li> Based off your understanding of this story, do you think this chart is useful or interesting? </li>
  <li> Is there anything you would change or do differently? </li>
</ul>
<h5> Closing Questions: All Interviewees </h5>
<ul> 
  <li> Who do you think is the intended audience for this? </li>
  <li> Did you feel like anything was missing that you’d like to see? </li>
  <li> What’s your opinion on Peace Corps’ ET rate now that you’ve read this? </li>
</ul>
<h5> Closing Question: Interviewees Unaffiliated with Peace Corps </h5>
<ul> 
  <li> How would you feel reading this project about an organization you work for or with? </li>
  </ul>

    <td> This is a more positive response to the $104,000 number, so I have to decide whether to keep it</td>

    <tr> 
      <td> What do you think this story is going to be about? </td>
      <td> It seems like that you’ve noticed that there might be some generalizable trend across peace corps that while volunteers sign up for 27 months of service, many do not complete. I assume you’ll differentiate between resignation, med sep, and some of the more personal reasons. </td>
      <td> Incorporate chart breaking down ET rate by broad reason for leaving. </td>

    <tr>
    <td> Who do you think is the intended audience for this? </td>
      <td> Non-PC people. It doesn’t to be aimed at RPCVs that are trying to understand what’s going on in Peace Corps. It’s trying to explore the unexplored truth about PC with people that wouldn’t otherwise be able to engage with it. The average every person kind of audience. </td>
    <td> This response was very different from the previous two responses. This might be because I changed the structure of the storyboard to start with Moldova in this version. Although the general population isn't my target audience, I don't think this is a bad thing. </td>
  </tr>
         <tr>
    <td> Did you feel like anything was missing that you’d like to see? </td>
      <td>  Based on your first slide, which suggested that these might be the top reasons volunteers leave, but I think there were issues that were included that just weren’t discussed, but they weren’t addressed so it makes me wonder where. Add a summary. You have to tell me what you told me. You need to have something that pulls it all together. You’ve got a lot of build up but there’s no pay off. Peace Corps $104,000 may be taken out of context.</td>
    <td> I'm going to consider taking out the $104,000 if I can find another way to emphasize the importance for Peace Corps because I think this is a good point, and I don't want Peace Corps to be shut down. I think changing the title will help me address some of the more exploratory concerns. I also think breaking down the response by motivator (job, mental heatlh, etc) would be helpful. I also should note that the version that this interviewee saw had a list of reasons volunteers left, which the first two didn't have. </td>

    <td> Other - Reaction to openning Photo </td>
    <td> I remember when I was at staging and the group of volunteers that were there and the ones that were and it evokes when my girlfriend left Peace Corps for health reasons. Even if they understood part of what it was like anything that comes after, they don’t understand.</td>
    <td> This was a response to the alternate photo with white dots in front of faces instead of the blurred faces. I'm definitely going to adopt this change given this response. </td>

  <th> Chart </th>

  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td> Do you intend to complete service? </td>
    <td> All of my interviewees thought that this result was from a survey volunteers completed before/at the beginning of service, but actually it's an annual survey volunteers take twice during service (at different times). One interviewee was confused by the red and blue because they'd become associated with good/bad. The acronyms at the bottom were confusing, even for people associated with Peace Corps and people found them unenecessary because they didn't give new information.
        </td>
      <td> 
        <ul>
      <li>  I have data about where volunteers are in service when they response, so I think I should explore whether there's a difference in response among volunteers who are more or less than a year into service. </li>
            <li> I'm also going to change the colors because the red and blue became associated with good/bad, which confused one responder.</li>
          <li> Get rid of regional breakdown </li>

Some people were confused about whether this was about Moldova, an issue that was resolved when I created a Moldova introductory section in the second wireframe version.</td>
            <td>
              <ul>
              <li> I think this is chart just needs some improved labels, but overall it's seemed to be clear, particularly in the second storyboard version.</li>

          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td> Unemployment Rate and ET Rate </td>
            <td> People generally understood this chart. I did get one visceral reaction from the Zambia Peace Corps Volunteer about my use of the unemployment rate. He thought that I was suggesting that only unemployed people join Peace Corps, and he was concerned I was suggesting causation. Overall people were very fascinated by this chart though. </td>
            <td> I think breaking this analysis section by motivations for leaving Peace Corps should maybe address some of the concern about the use of unemployment rate, but it's something I'll have to think about more. </td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td> Assault Chart </td>
          </tr>
          </table>
<p> * Note: I left some charts (like the OIG and mental health chart out because they were added later on) and need considerable work. </p>
<h2> Summary of Next Steps </h2>
<ul>
  <li> Write very clear transitions and explanations of what is happening and how the story is transitioning. </li>
    <li> Add a summary of what I've discussed in my presentation right before the call to action. Overall, I want to say that there are a lot of reasons volunteers leave. Regardless of why they leave, there are clear ways that Peace Corps can improve how it supports volunteers. </li>
  <li> Restructure the reasons volunteers leave to be by category: Jobs, Health, Crime. If I restructure it this way, I can combine:
    <li> the unemployment chart with data about volunteers joining Peace Corps to gain work experience, the number of volunteers who have enough work, and the OIG data about insufficient work for volunteers. </li>
  <li> the mental health chart with the OIG mental health results </li>
</li>
  <li> People found the title clear, but I think it also made them think I would have more reasons to explain why volunteers are leaving. I think changing the title to something like: Too Many Peace Corps Volunteers Are Leaving Service Early. Peace Corps administrative changes could help. </li>
  <li> Gather and add qualitative quotes for each potential motivator of leaving service early. Maybe take some from <a href= "https://www.instagram.com/peacecorpshr/?hl=en" target="_blank"> Peace Corps HR? </a> </li>
  <li> This isn't from my research, but I know that Peace Corps doesn't deal with diversity issues well, and I'd like to figure out a way to incorporate this. </li>
  <li> Create mental health section </li>
  <li> A number of interviewees were confused by the transition to global data from Moldova data, so I need make that transition clearer. </li>
  </ul>
