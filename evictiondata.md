<h2> My Process </h2>
<p> I started this process by thinking about what story this article was telling and how visualizing the eviction risk by states could be used to help forward the story’s call to action. The critique method helped me think about what data should be included and whether the visualization was communicating what the authors wanted it to communicate. Given the story’s final call to action, I wanted to make sure the visualization helped maximize audience engagement. This emphasis on audience engagement made me think “Data is Personal” by Evan Peck. I loved his idea of focusing on personal details (like Pennsylvania) before expanding to an overview (like of the United States). I thought this would help make the material personal, convey the humanity of the people at risk of eviction, and encourage audience engagement.
<br><br>
My main vision became trying to personalize the millions of people facing eviction. I wanted to try to ground them in our local communities before expanding out to try to get the reader to conceptualize increasingly larger numbers of people. To do this, I thought about how I visualize large numbers of people. Particularly with evictions, I find it powerful to imagine the evictions as apartment buildings, blocks, and even entire cities empty of people. I hoped to be able to convey this feeling to my audience.

With this vision, I started sketching wireframes. While sketching, I had ideas for unit charts and tree charts, which came together and inspired me to make a story. I wanted to make sure my interviewees felt the personal experience, so I sketched three states that were relevant to the people I was interviewing: New York, Pennsylvania, and Minnesota. These conversations helped me refine my idea and consolidate the story. They also reinforced my vision of making the data personal, and one interviewee even alerted me to the influence of the wealth chart we examined on the first day of class. After feedback I decide to have four story pages: the state, the street view, a unit chart (later removed), and two tree charts. 
<br><br>
My final version looks a bit different than the wireframes I imagined. I think I bit off a bit more than I could chew trying to make a story in Tableau for the first time, particularly since Tableau isn’t great for making unit charts. There were aspects of the wireframes and my vision that I couldn’t materialize using Tableau, but I hope to continue learning to use Tableau to improve it or to eventually redesign it using another software. </p>
